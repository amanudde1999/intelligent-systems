This repository contains projects that I completed while completing the ECE 449: Intelligent Systems course at the University of Alberta. These projects involve three main concepts: Neural Netowrks, Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithms and each project has its respective report which describes the project in more detail.
